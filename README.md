run_analysis programs without passing any parameters. run_analysis() can be run R prompt after setting the setwd() to the root of the data source i.e where the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory resides. The directory where the run_analysis() should be run should contain the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder (as the file is unzipped). Off course, all the subsequently directories such as train and test should be presevered from zipped version.
